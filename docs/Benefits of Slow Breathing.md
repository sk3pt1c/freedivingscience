Slow breathing practices have been adopted in the modern world across the globe due to their
claimed health benefits. This has piqued the interest of researchers and clinicians who have initiated
investigations into the physiological (and psychological) effects of slow breathing techniques
and attempted to uncover the underlying mechanisms. The aim of this article is to provide a
comprehensive overview of normal respiratory physiology and the documented physiological effects
of slow breathing techniques according to research in healthy humans. The review focuses on
the physiological implications to the respiratory, cardiovascular, cardiorespiratory and autonomic
nervous systems, with particular focus on diaphragm activity, ventilation efficiency, haemodynamics,
heart rate variability, cardiorespiratory coupling, respiratory sinus arrhythmia and sympathovagal
balance. The review ends with a brief discussion of the potential clinical implications of slow
breathing techniques. This is a topic that warrants further research, understanding and discussion.
